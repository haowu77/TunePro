## TunePro Support

Thank you for using TunePro!

**Usage**

This app allows you to tune your instrument with ease.

As the wedges on the right hand side change from clear to yellow the note is becoming increasingly sharp.

As the wedges on the left hand side change from red to clear the note is becoming decreasingly flat.

The wedges turn green when your note is in tune. Simple!

**Preferences**

- Tap on the area outside the tuner to change the theme. Currently there is the standard dark theme as well as a retro-gray theme.

- Tap on the area inside the tuner to toggle between using either sharp notes or flat notes.

**Feedback**

Please leave a review on the app store if you're enjoying using TunePro! Suggestions for future improvements are also welcomed!
